      <h4>
        Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act
        (CalOPPA)
      </h4>
      <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
        websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach
        stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
        United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites
        collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers
        to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
        information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being
        shared, and to comply with this policy &mdash; See more at:{" "}

        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be
          found on this Privacy Policy page from the home page of our website or
          mobile application;
        </li>
        <li>
          users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy
          Policy Page;
        </li>
        <li>
          users are able to change their personal information by{" "}
          <a href="mailto:support@webreactionz.com">emailing us</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature. As there is not
        yet an accepted standard for how to respond to Do Not Track signals, our
        website does not respond to such signals.
      </p>
      <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>

        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are
        advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
