Web Reactionz lets you tailor the look and feel of the reaction widget to align with your website's aesthetics. You can customise:

- The emoji reaction options
- Whether or not a user should be able to react multiple times, and if so, in what time frame
- Whether or not you want the widget to have a border
- Whether or not you want to show the reaction counts
- Whether the emojis should be listed horizontally or vertically
- What the prompt text should be
- Where you want the reaction widget to be placed relative to an element on your page (or if you want it to be 'sticky' alongside the right/left of an element as the user scrolls)
- The font colour and size

#### Examples

Below are a few examples of reaction widgets that can be configured in less than a minute through the no-code dashboard:

_Styles great for documentation and support pages, with hidden reaction counts:_

<div className="blogImages">
![Minimal theme, horizontal emojis with "Was this helpful?" prompt text on the left](/blog/themes/minimal_docs.png)

![Multiline theme, horizontal emojis with "Did this answer your question" prompt text above the emojis](/blog/themes/multiline_docs.png)

</div>

_Styles great for blogs, with visible reaction counts and suitable for fixed positioning on the side of blog content (just like on the left of this page!):_

<div align="center">
  ![Minimial theme, vertical emojis, with visible reaction counts and no prompt
  text](/blog/themes/multiline_blog_vertical.png)
</div>

#### Further customisation

You can customise the reaction widget even further with some basic knowledge of [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). See the [Support](/support) page for more details.
